# Schema Design Rules

Every column, every type, every constraint must be intentional. Ambiguous schema destroys codebase understanding.

## Column Documentation (Non-Negotiable)

- Every column MUST have a `COMMENT ON COLUMN` in the migration
- The comment MUST explain the **semantic meaning**, not restate the type
- If you cannot explain why a column exists, it should not exist

```sql
-- WRONG: restates type
COMMENT ON COLUMN orders.total IS 'integer total';

-- WRONG: no comment at all
CREATE TABLE orders (total INT);

-- CORRECT: explains meaning, unit, and constraints
COMMENT ON COLUMN orders.total_cents IS 'Order total in cents (USD). Always positive. Use cents to avoid floating point.';
COMMENT ON COLUMN orders.status IS 'Lifecycle state: pending → confirmed → shipped → delivered → cancelled. Set by handler, never by trigger.';
COMMENT ON COLUMN orders.user_id IS 'References users(id). The customer who placed this order. NOT NULL — every order must have an owner.';
```

## Type Selection (Every Choice Needs Justification)

| Decision | Question to Answer |
|----------|-------------------|
| `UUID` vs `BIGSERIAL` | Distributed generation needed? URL-safe? Predictability concern? |
| `TEXT` vs `VARCHAR(n)` | Is there a real domain maximum? If not, use TEXT |
| `INT` vs `BIGINT` | Will values exceed 2^31? Use BIGINT for IDs and counters |
| `NUMERIC(p,s)` vs `INT` | Is there a fractional part? Money → cents as INT or NUMERIC |
| `TIMESTAMPTZ` vs `TIMESTAMP` | Always use TIMESTAMPTZ unless you have a documented reason not to |
| `BOOLEAN` vs status column | Only two states ever? Then BOOLEAN. Otherwise, TEXT with CHECK |
| `JSONB` | Only for truly dynamic/schemaless data. NEVER to avoid schema design |
| `ARRAY` | Only for small, atomic sets. NEVER for relationships |

## Nullable Rules

- MUST default to `NOT NULL` — nullable is the exception
- Every nullable column MUST have a comment explaining when/why it is null
- Nullable means "absence of value is semantically meaningful"
- If a column has a sensible default, use `DEFAULT` instead of nullable

```sql
-- WRONG: nullable without reason
shipped_at TIMESTAMPTZ,

-- CORRECT: nullable with documented semantics
shipped_at TIMESTAMPTZ,  -- NULL until order ships. Set by shipOrder handler.
```

## Constraint Rules

See: database.md for schema constraints (NOT NULL, FK, CHECK, DEFAULT) and migration constraints.

## Enum/Status Pattern

- MUST use `TEXT` column with `CHECK` constraint
- MUST define all valid values in the CHECK
- MUST document the state machine (transitions) in the column comment

```sql
status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pending'
    CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'confirmed', 'shipped', 'delivered', 'cancelled')),

COMMENT ON COLUMN orders.status IS 'Lifecycle: pending → confirmed → shipped → delivered. Can be cancelled from pending or confirmed only.';
```

## Money Pattern

- MUST store money as integer cents (`total_cents INT NOT NULL CHECK (total_cents >= 0)`)
- Or use `NUMERIC(10,2)` if fractional precision is required
- NEVER use `FLOAT` or `DOUBLE PRECISION` for money
- MUST document the currency in the column comment

## Go Struct ↔ Schema Alignment

- Every Go struct field MUST match its SQL column type precisely
- MUST use sqlc overrides for type mapping when defaults are insufficient
- Non-nullable SQL → non-pointer Go type
- Nullable SQL → pointer Go type or `pgtype.*`

| SQL Type | Go Type | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| `UUID` | `string` | Via sqlc override |
| `TIMESTAMPTZ` | `time.Time` | Via sqlc override |
| `TEXT NOT NULL` | `string` | Direct |
| `TEXT NULL` | `*string` or `pgtype.Text` | Must handle nil |
| `INT NOT NULL` | `int32` or `int64` | Match SQL precision |
| `NUMERIC(10,2)` | `pgtype.Numeric` | Never float64 |
| `BOOLEAN` | `bool` | Direct |
| `JSONB` | `json.RawMessage` or typed struct | Prefer typed |

## Review Checklist (db-reviewer MUST verify)

For every migration or schema change:

- [ ] Every column has a `COMMENT ON COLUMN`
- [ ] Every type choice is justified (not just default)
- [ ] Nullable columns have documented semantics
- [ ] All references have foreign keys
- [ ] All enums have CHECK constraints
- [ ] Money uses integer cents or NUMERIC, never float
- [ ] Timestamps use TIMESTAMPTZ
- [ ] Go types in store.go match SQL types precisely
- [ ] Index exists for every WHERE clause column in queries
- [ ] 3NF is achieved (no transitive dependencies)
